Hi, this is my **Pet Project** for finding movies.   
I use an open API from the [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) site   
There is no API KEY in the project, if you want to get an API KEY, look here - [API KEY](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

**Libraries used:**
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview?authuser=2&hl=ru)
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines?hl=de)
- App Architecture - MVVM
